### About
- Description: My Personal Porfolio — a static site built to show my work, skills, and contact info.
- Languages: HTML (~30.5%), CSS (~36.3%), JavaScript (~33.2%)

### What’s inside
- A static, responsive portfolio built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- Sections: About, Projects, Skills, Contact, and a playful micro-interaction or two.
- Mobile-friendly layout and accessible color contrast (aimed for good readability).

### Getting started (local)
No build step required — this is a static site. Options to run locally:
1. Open index.html directly in your browser (simple, but some features like fetch may require a server).

### Project structure (example)
- index.html — entry point
- assets/
  - css/ — stylesheets
  - js/ — scripts
  - img/ — images/screenshots
- README.md — this file
